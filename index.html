        <h1>Scott Yasuda</h1>
        <p>Hi, my name is Scott and I advocate for the efficiency of the user in UX Design. I 
          enjoy meeting the users and understanding their frustrations to make positive 
          iterations on current products. </p>

                <h3>Understanding the user</h3>
                <p>UX Research is a pivotal aspect of the design process, that if gone unnoticed, will result in a breakdown of a product. 
                  Through user interviews and plenty of user testing, I have thoroughly enjoyed working to fix user frustrations to provide 
                  a more enjoyable experience.
